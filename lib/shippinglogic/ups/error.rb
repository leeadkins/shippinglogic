  class UPS
    # If UPS responds with an error, we try our best to pull the pertinent information out of that
    # response and raise it with this object. Any time UPS says there is a problem an object of this
    # class will be raised.
    #
    # === Tip
    #
    # If you want to see the raw request / respose catch the error object and call the request / response method. Ex:
    #
    #   begin
    #     # my UPS code
    #   rescue Shippinglogic::UPS::Error => e
    #     # do whatever you want here, just do:
    #     # e.request
    #     # e.response
    #     # to get the raw response from UPS
    #   end
    class Error < Shippinglogic::Error

            "There was a problem with your UPS request, and we couldn't locate a specific error message. This means your response " +
